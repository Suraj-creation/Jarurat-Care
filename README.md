## 💝 The Story Behind Our Mission

> *"In loving memory of Rekha Joshi (1963-2023)"*

Jarurat Care Foundation was born from a deeply personal journey. **Rekha Joshi**, a beloved mother, was diagnosed with **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer) - a rare and aggressive form of cancer. Despite the best medical efforts, she passed away in **December 2023**.

Her daughter, **Priyanka Joshi**, along with **Ayush Anand**, transformed their grief into purpose. They founded Jarurat Care Foundation to ensure that no cancer patient or family has to face this battle alone.

Our name embodies our philosophy:
- **"Jarurat"** (जरूरत) means "Need" in Hindi
- **"Care"** represents our commitment to compassionate support
- **"Jaisi Jarurat, Vaisi Care"** - As the Need, So the Care

We understand that every patient's needs are unique, and we tailor our support accordingly.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Demo)

| API Key | Exposed in JS | For production, use backend proxy |
| Form Validation | Client-side | Basic validation implemented |
| HTTPS | Depends on host | Recommended for production |

### Production Recommendations

1. **Backend API Proxy** - Never expose API keys in frontend
2. **Database Integration** - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Supabase
3. **Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based auth
4. **HIPAA Compliance** - For handling patient health information
5. **Data Encryption** - At rest and in transit
6. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent API abuse
7. **Input Sanitization** - Prevent XSS and injection attacks
